elMake is Free Software, see the GPL for details.

Note: Do not expect elMake to work in current state of development ;)

Single-user installation
------------------------

To install elmake, open elmake-self-install.el in emacs.  You will see
some lines stating

;; place your cursor in the next (empty) line and press C-x C-e
-!-
);; have fun with elmake!

Place point where the -!- sign is and press C-x C-e to install elmake.
You will be asked for a directory for installing elmake to - enter a
directory where you have write access to, as all packages you will
install using elmake will be installed into subdirectories of it.
This directory need not be in the load path, however, it does not
matter if it is.

Next you have to enter a place where info files should be installed
to. As info files are not only used by emacs, this directory should be
part of your info path. (However, if you only use info inside emacs,
you can place it outside your info path as well - or you can add it to
your info path manually.)

The last question wants to know where to put elmake's initialization
code. GNU emacs users will most probably select the `~/.emacs'
file, users of XEmacs the `~/.xemacs/init.el' file.

After these three questions, elmake will bootstrap itself (run its own
elmake file) and add initialization code to the end of that file.



Multi-user installation
-----------------------

You will find information about multi-user installation in the info file.
(Info-goto-node "(elmake)Installation") <-- C-x C-e here.
